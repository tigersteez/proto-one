# What is it?
A browser based game, that generates a link between your phone and your current game session so that you control the game on your laptop by using your phone. We're mainly brainstorming the mechanics of this setup right now, and not so much the actually game type or play, but are gonna prototype some simple like galaga or brick breaker type things first.

# Are any games currently doing this? 
Not that would could think of. 

# Would we have to develop an app to run on the phone? Or would the phone aspect be browser based too?
No, the phone aspect would also run in the browser. Basically when you started playing the game, it would generate a dynamic and unique url which you would then either have texted to you or you could type it in yourself. Then that link on your phone would take you to a unique controller that was tied to the game session you currently had open on your laptop
